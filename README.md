# StudentAdmissionProgramComplete
student admissions program complete
Main.py drives all the files
four classes , student_class has two children internationalStudent_class & domesticStudent_class, totScore_class is unrelated but utilized by international_student
help_func includes a bunch of functions that complete the prorgam
international-stu.txt and domestic-stu.txt contain the data which is read into class

in main, two functions, dom_stu_list() and int_stu_list() start the extraction of data and instantiate class objects, each function also has a menu which several options
can be chosen which call class methods to add,delete,searchs,sort,and display the data from each class that is stored in lists. The sorting procedure for each class
needs to be performed in the same manner or else the program restarts. The final nested function merges both lists into one, and assigns student numbers and Ids.
